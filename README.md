 README for JavaScript Data Types and Control Structures Assignment

 Overview
This assignment involves creating a JavaScript file named `DataTypes.js` that explores various data types, control structures, and string manipulation techniques in JavaScript. The tasks outlined in this document will help solidify your understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, user input, and string methods.

 Tasks

1. Variable Declaration:
   - Declare the following variables with assigned values:
     - `firstName`
     - `lastName`
     - `country`
     - `city`
     - `age`
     - `isMarried`
     - `year`
   - Utilize the `typeof` operator to determine and display the data types of these variables.

2. Type Comparison:
   - Check if the type of the string `'10'` is equal to the number `10`.
   - Check if `parseInt` is equal to `10`.

3. Boolean Values:
   - Provide three JavaScript statements that evaluate to truthy values.
   - Provide three JavaScript statements that evaluate to falsy values.

4. Logical Expressions:
   - Evaluate the following logical expressions without using `console.log`, then confirm the results:
     - `4 > 3 && 10 < 12`
     - `4 > 3 && 10 > 12`
     - `4 > 3 || 10 < 12`
     - `4 > 3 || 10 > 12`
     - `!`
     - `!`
     - `!`
     - `!`
     - `!`
     - `!`

5. Area of a Triangle:
   - Create a script that prompts the user to enter the base and height of a triangle, and calculates the area using the formula:
     - Area = 0.5 × base × height

6. Driving Eligibility:
   - Prompt the user for their birth year. Calculate their age and inform them if they are old enough to drive. Provide a message with the waiting period if not.

7. String Manipulation:
   - Declare a variable named `challenge` and assign it the value `'30 Days Of JavaScript'`.
   - Perform the following string manipulations:
     - Change all characters to uppercase using `toUpperCase`.
     - Change all characters to lowercase using `toLowerCase`.
     - Slice out the first word.
     - Slice out the phrase 'Days Of JavaScript'.
     - Check if the string contains the word 'Script' using `includes`.
     - Use `indexOf` to find the position of the first occurrence of 'a' in the string.
     - Use `lastIndexOf` to find the position of the last occurrence of 'a'.
     - Use `indexOf` to find the first occurrence of 'because' in the sentence: `'You cannot end a sentence with because because because is a conjunction'`.
     - Use `startsWith` and `endsWith` methods to check for occurrences of '30 Days Of JavaScript'.

8. Random Number Generation:
   - Generate a random number between 0 and 100 inclusively.

9. Comparison of Two Variables:
   - Declare two variables named `a` and `b`, and implement the following:
     - Using an if-else statement, determine if `a` is greater than or less than `b` and return appropriate messages.
     - Using a ternary operator, provide the same comparison.

10. Student Grading System:
    - Declare a variable named `scores` and write a code segment to assign grades based on the following criteria:
      - 80-100: A
      - 70-89: B
      - 60-69: C
      - 50-59: D
      - 0-49: F
    - Log the resulting grade to the console.

 Conclusion
This assignment will enhance your understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including data types, logical operators, and string manipulation. Make sure to test your code thoroughly and confirm the expected outputs as you progress through the tasks. Happy coding!
